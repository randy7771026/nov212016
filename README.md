Visualize crime stats for area of Greater Northside Management District
It starts with:

http://data.ohouston.org/dataset/houston-police-department-crime-statistics

type data that Sgt. Morrison as recently as last Friday tells me is going real time. In the meanwhile the feed to:

http://houston.everyblock.com/?only=crime-reports

seems to be live again after a month on hiatus.

So all of that plus api collection of meta data from social networks but geolocated and though it 
looks like we can pull meta from Nextdoor

https://northsidevillagewest.nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=29950752

because there are end points, do they want us to and should we.

Note to self but y'all can read and do:

If for testing and demo you go back three months in archive and build layers on a map of different types of crime
then give them a date range choice and allow to animate one day at time and how many days to have on map at one time
then a button to freeze and after freeze pens with hover over bubble UCR info. Thanks that is the essence of Phase I. 
Phase two is to add similar for social media scrapes or api calls.
